📊 **Situation** 

**A New Patient Analytics Dashboard 📈 to help us understand patient data better.**       
                
          To provide quick insights ✨ into things like patient groups 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, treatment results ✅, 
          and costs 💲,to support data-driven decision-making 🧠.

🎯 **Task**

**Build this comprehensive dashboard from scratch 🏗️. This involved developing and visualising key performance indicators (KPIs) 📊**

        such as patient distribution by indication 🌍, treatment success rates 🏆, cost per patient 💰, 
        readmission rates 🔄, length of stay ⏱️, treatment efficacy comparisons ⚖️, and mortality rates 💔,         
        applying various filters for detailed analysis 🔬.

💻**Action**

**I began by breaking down each required KPI 🧩 to understand its underlying data requirements and relationships.** 
        
        This involved identifying all necessary data points like age 👵👴, ethnicity 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, payer type 💳, 
        indication 🤒, treatment 💊, outcomes 👍, and costs 💵. 

**I created detailed charts for patient demographics 📊, utilised heatmaps 🔥 to highlight readmission risks,** 
        
        and developed comparative views for treatment efficacy and mortality. 

**I implemented all specified filters 🔍, such as age group, ethnicity, payer type, provider type,** 
        
        and pharmacy type, to allow for granular data exploration. 


✅ **Result**

**I successfully delivered a fully functional 👍 and insightful Patient Analytics Dashboard 🚀**

        It effectively presented all the specified KPIs and filters, enabling stakeholders to visualise critical patterns📈, 
        understand treatment effectiveness ✅, identify cost variations 💲, and pinpoint areas of high risk 🚩. 

**This dashboard significantly enhanced our ability to derive meaningful insights from patient data 🧠,**

**Supporting more informed decision-making in patient care 🌟.**
